# Simple Store Clone - React + Vite + Tailwind

Ye ek chota sa ecommerce UI clone hai jo FakeStoreAPI use karta hai.
Project simple rakha gaya hai taaki exam/assignment me "student-made" lage.

## Features
- Product list from FakeStoreAPI
- Search by product title / description
- Responsive grid of product cards
- Simple neutral styling using Tailwind
- No fancy gradients / neon colors

## Run locally
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open browser at the vite address (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Notes
- UI intentionally simple
- Buttons are neutral (black/gray) - avoid AI-like flashy colors
- If API slow, wait a sec for products to load
